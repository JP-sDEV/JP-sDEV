<h1 align='center'>👋 Hello!</h1>

Glad to see you here! I'm Vinit Shahdeo, a Software Engineer with a strong passion for JavaScript and open-source. I'm honored to be recognized as a [GitHub Star](https://stars.github.com/profiles/vinitshahdeo/) twice from India! With a knack for building event-driven architecture, I balance code with badminton 🏸 and find peace in a sip of tea 🍵 and poetry 🎙️. 

Currently, I'm building seamless neobanking solutions at Novo as a **Senior Backend Engineer** (`L4`), following 4.5 years as a Software Engineer (`L1` & `L2`) at Postman. My notable contributions at Postman include building Interceptor and Integrations. Discover more about my Postman journey and valuable lessons. I've had the privilege of mentoring in GSoC at AsyncAPI and Postman.
